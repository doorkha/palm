    <h1>This is the main headline of the article</h1>
    <h2>This is a second level heading</h2>
    <p>Here comes the first paragraph of text that describes what this article will be about. Its second sentence is so important it gets marked additionally.</p>
    <p>"Then comes a longer quotation from long ago that makes you think."</p>
    <p>In the second paragraph there is nothing interesting. But after the second paragraph there is an image of a tree.</p>
    <img src="assets/palm.jpg" alt="palm">
        <h2>Another second level heading.</h2>
        <p>Here comes a nested list to prove the author's point:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>with items</li>
        <li>under each other
        <ul>
        <li>and second level items</li>
        <li>also</li>
        </ul></ul>
    <p>A short table with the 
          <br>convincing numbers</p>
            <table>
              <caption>first column	second column</caption>
              <tr>
                  <td>data-1</td> <td>data-2</td>
              </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>data-3</td> <td>data-4</td>
              </tr>
